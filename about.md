![Me](http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~kgp/kgp-washington.jpg)

Hi! I am an software engineer currently working in the bay area. Workwise I am interested in writing distributed, highly scalable software, or software to process large data sets (sometimes these problems are not mutually exclusive).  My other interests lie in hiking/travelling (I am a recent transplant to the bay area, so there is plenty to discover), cooking, or playing games ( happens far too frequently).
