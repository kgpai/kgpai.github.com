![Me](http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~kgp/kgp-washington.jpg)

Hi! I am an software engineer currently working in Seattle. Workwise I am interested in writing distributed, highly scalable software. My other interests lie in hiking (The puget sound area is awesome for that), practising my guitar (this happens very rarely though), or playing games ( happens far too frequently).
